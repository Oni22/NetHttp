# NetHttp

The NetHttp is a lightweight library which is build on the principles of Javascripts promises. With this library you can do http request like you do it in javascripts. 
It orientates on the syntax from the javascript promises.

IMPORTANT: This library is still in alpha status. I'm trying to improve the syntax continously to get the best result. Try it out and help me 
to find bugs :)
